# camera2QRcodeReader
Simple real time QR code reader implementation.
Not the best one but will give you an idea of how to use the new camera2 API for the application that run on Lollipop (API21) an up using the ImageReader's surface target - the camera streams the data through and you can check for a QR in the real time.
Hopefully it will be handy for some people.
NOTE: it is an experimental one and you should definitely use the idea ONLY and feel free to improve it and make pull requests.
Being a beginner myself, I appreciate any advice or comment.
